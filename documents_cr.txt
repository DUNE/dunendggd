##CR's bad docs

gegede-cli -o ggdex.gdml ggdex.cfg uses the cfg file to output the desired gdml file so that you can display it.

To work on the window you need to go to duneggd/Config/ArgonCube directory to work on the config files.
And go to /duneggd/Active to work on the rectangle bars or duneggd.SubDetector.ComplexSubDetector.ComplexSubDetectorBuilder to work on the 
the full volume that contains the rectangle bar daughter volumes.

#gegede info

This uses gegede from github's brettviren/gegede branch
The default schema is written as a Python data structure and is available as the dictionary gegede.schema.Schema, (in the source at ./python/gegede/schema/__init__.py)

I think you can make triangles from trapezoid.
for trapezoid dy2 is the height of recatangle in x-y plane, then dy1 is the height of the additional shape on top of the rectangle
dx1 and dx2 are then the normal distances but for shape created in the x-z plane
Actually trapezoid is more complecated than this, so best use the original triangles made and boolean subtract half away with a cube

the shapes are used with
from gegede.construct import Geometry
geom = Geometry()
box1 = geom.shapes.Box("box1", '1.0m', '2 m', '3 meter')

####This is very important #####

pos variable in boolean is the position on the second shape relative to the first!!!!

### another very important thing, when using multiple boolean shapes where you have shape 3 attached to shape 2 attached to shape 1,
the positioning of shape 3 is relative to shape 2, not shape 1 (in my case the shape in the world config.

When using a shape to make a hole you have to make sure that the shape making the hole is bigger the direction you want to remove the material. Also, if you remove material, then remove material again with another shape it can use
the removal of the last shape rather than first, so it can give you material.

note 5/10/23
###
The config chain of builders and subBuilder for the muon window is:

the world at duneggd/Config/WORLDggd.cfg,
then ND_Hall_Rock at duneggd/Config/ND_Hall_Rock.cfg
then ND_Hall_Air_Volume at duneggd/Config/ND_Hall_Air_Volume_LAr_TMS_SAND.cfg
then ArgonCubeDetector at duneggd/Config/ArgonCube/ArgonCubeCryostat.cfg ################### note it is not in the config duneggd/Config/ArgonCube/ArgonCubeDetector.cfg which I find a bit odd
all other subBuilders are in duneggd/Config/ArgonCube/ArgonCubeCryostat.cfg
so the rest are ArgonCubeCryostatWithTagger
with subB ArgonCubeCryostat
with subB CompositeWindow
